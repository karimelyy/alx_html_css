            <h1> 1. What is protein? </h1>
            <p>Protein is a nutrient your body needs to grow and repair cells, and to work properly.
                Protein is found in a wide range of food and it’s important that you get enough protein in your diet every day.
                How much protein you need from your diet varies depending on your weight, gender, age and health.
                Meeting your protein needs is easily achieved from eating a variety of foods. Protein from food comes from plant
                and animal sources such as: meat and fish, eggs, dairy products, seeds and nuts, legumes like beans and lentils.
            </p>

            <h2> 2. Proteins are made of amino acids </h2>
            <p>Proteins are made up of building blocks called amino acids. There are about 20 different amino acids that link
                together in different combinations. Your body uses them to make new proteins, such as muscle and bone, and other
                compounds such as enzymes and hormones. It can also use them as an energy source.
                Some amino acids can be made by your body – there are 11 of these and they’re known as non-essential amino
                acids. There are 9 amino acids that your body cannot make, and they are known as essential amino acids. You need
                to include enough of these in your diet so that your body can function.</p>
            <h3> 3. Nutritional value of protein </h3>
            <p>The nutritional value of a protein is measured by the quantity of essential amino acids it contains.
                Different foods contain different amounts of essential amino acids. Generally:
                Animal products (such as chicken, beef or fish and dairy products) have all of the essential amino acids and are
                known as 'complete' protein (or ideal or high-quality protein).
                Soy products, quinoa and the seed of a leafy green called amaranth (consumed in Asia and the Mediterranean) also
                have all of the essential amino acids.
                Plant proteins (beans, lentils, nuts and whole grains) usually lack at least one of the essential amino acids
                and are considered 'incomplete' proteins.</p>
